The most important part of the application - the implementation of Google Maps, where to visualize the locations of manufacturers. Also to locate the producer himself and to be directed to the nearest producers.
A more complex search engine is about to be implemented, which will filter by different criteria.
A section is to be implemented in which producers can place urgent ads for food that needs to be donated or sold quickly, as there is a danger of spoiling - FoodLosses.
